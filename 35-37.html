	<p class="dropcap">The sitting-room of Legree's establishment was a large, long room, with a wide, ample fireplace. It had once been hung with a showy and expensive paper, which now hung mouldering, torn and discolored, from the damp walls. The place had that peculiar sickening, unwholesome smell, compounded of mingled damp, dirt and decay, which one often notices in close old houses. The wall-paper was defaced, in spots, by slops of beer and wine; or garnished with chalk memorandums, and long sums footed up, as if somebody had been practising arithmetic there. In the fireplace stood a brazier full of burning charcoal; for, though the weather was not cold, the evenings always seemed damp and chilly in that great room; and Legree, moreover, wanted a place to light his cigars, and heat his water for punch. The ruddy glare of the charcoal displayed the confused and unpromising aspect of the room,—saddles, bridles, several sorts of harness, riding-whips, overcoats, and various articles of clothing, scattered up and down the room in confused variety; and the dogs, of whom we have before spoken, had encamped themselves among them, to suit their own taste and convenience.</p>
	<p>Legree was just mixing himself a tumbler of punch, pouring his hot water from a cracked and broken-nosed pitcher, grumbling, as he did so,</p>
	<p>“Plague on that Sambo, to kick up this yer row between me and the new hands! The fellow won't be fit to work for a week, now,—right in the press of the season!”</p>
	<p>“Yes, just like you,” said a voice, behind his chair. It was the woman Cassy, who had stolen upon his soliloquy.</p>
	<p>“Hah! you she-devil! you've come back, have you?”</p>
	<p>“Yes, I have,” she said, coolly; “come to have my own way, too!”</p>
	<p>“You lie, you jade! I'll be up to my word. Either behave yourself, or stay down to the quarters, and fare and work with the rest.”</p>
	<p>“I'd rather, ten thousand times,” said the woman, “live in the dirtiest hole at the quarters, than be under your hoof!”</p>
	<p>“But you <span class="hi">are</span> under my hoof, for all that,” said he, turning upon her, with a savage grin; “that's one comfort. So, sit down here on my knee, my dear, and hear to reason,” said he, laying hold on her wrist.</p>
	<p>“Simon Legree, take care!” said the woman, with a sharp flash of her eye, a glance so wild and insane in its light as to be almost appalling. “You're afraid of me, Simon,” she said, deliberately; “and you've reason to be! But be careful, for I've got the devil in me!”</p>
	<p>The last words she whispered in a hissing tone, close to his ear.</p>
	<p>“Get out! I believe, to my soul, you have!” said Legree, pushing her from him, and looking uncomfortably at her. “After all, Cassy,” he said, “why can't you be friends with me, as you used to?”</p>
	<p>“Used to!” said she, bitterly. She stopped short,—a word of choking feelings, rising in her heart, kept her silent.</p>
	<p>Cassy had always kept over Legree the kind of influence that a strong, impassioned woman can ever keep over the most brutal man; but, of late, she had grown more and more irritable and restless, under the hideous yoke of her servitude, and her irritability, at times, broke out into raving insanity; and this liability made her a sort of object of dread to Legree, who had that superstitious horror of insane persons which is common to coarse and uninstructed minds. When Legree brought Emmeline to the house, all the smouldering embers of womanly feeling flashed up in the worn heart of Cassy, and she took part with the girl; and a fierce quarrel ensued between her and Legree. Legree, in a fury, swore she should be put to field service, if she would not be peaceable. Cassy, with proud scorn, declared she <span class="hi">would</span> go to the field. And she worked there one day, as we have described, to show how perfectly she scorned the threat.</p>
	<p>Legree was secretly uneasy, all day; for Cassy had an influence over him from which he could not free himself. When she presented her basket at the scales, he had hoped for some concession, and addressed her in a sort of half conciliatory, half scornful tone; and she had answered with the bitterest contempt.</p>
	<p>The outrageous treatment of poor Tom had roused her still more; and she had followed Legree to the house, with no particular intention, but to upbraid him for his brutality.</p>
	<p>“I wish, Cassy,” said Legree, “you'd behave yourself decently.”</p>
	<p>“You talk about behaving decently! And what have you been doing?—you, who haven't even sense enough to keep from spoiling one of your best hands, right in the most pressing season, just for your devilish temper!”</p>
	<p>“I was a fool, it's a fact, to let any such brangle come up,” said Legree; “but, when the boy set up his will, he had to be broke in.”</p>
	<p>“I reckon you won't break <span class="hi">him</span> in!”</p>
	<p>“Won't I?” said Legree, rising, passionately. “I'd like to know if I won't? He'll be the first nigger that ever came it round me! I'll break every bone in his body, but he <span class="hi">shall</span> give up!”</p>
	<p>Just then the door opened, and Sambo entered. He came forward, bowing, and holding out something in a paper.</p>
	<p>“What's that, you dog?” said Legree.</p>
	<p>“It's a witch thing, Mas'r!”</p>
	<p>“A what?”</p>
	<p>“Something that niggers gets from witches. Keeps 'em from feelin' when they 's flogged. He had it tied round his neck, with a black string.”</p>
	<p>Legree, like most godless and cruel men, was superstitious. He took the paper, and opened it uneasily.</p>
	<p>There dropped out of it a silver dollar, and a long, shining curl of fair hair,—hair which, like a living thing, twined itself round Legree's fingers.</p>
	<p>“Damnation!” he screamed, in sudden passion, stamping on the floor, and pulling furiously at the hair, as if it burned him. “Where did this come from? Take it off!—burn it up!—burn it up!” he screamed, tearing it off, and throwing it into the charcoal. “What did you bring it to me for?”</p>
	<p>Sambo stood, with his heavy mouth wide open, and aghast with wonder; and Cassy, who was preparing to leave the apartment, stopped, and looked at him in perfect amazement.</p>
	<p>“Don't you bring me any more of your devilish things!” said he, shaking his fist at Sambo, who retreated hastily towards the door; and, picking up the silver dollar, he sent it smashing through the window-pane, out into the darkness.</p>
	<p>Sambo was glad to make his escape. When he was gone, Legree seemed a little ashamed of his fit of alarm. He sat doggedly down in his chair, and began sullenly sipping his tumbler of punch.</p>
	<p>Cassy prepared herself for going out, unobserved by him; and slipped away to minister to poor Tom, as we have already related.</p>
	<p>And what was the matter with Legree? and what was there in a simple curl of fair hair to appall that brutal man, familiar with every form of cruelty? To answer this, we must carry the reader backward in his history. Hard and reprobate as the godless man seemed now, there had been a time when he had been rocked on the bosom of a mother,—cradled with prayers and pious hymns,—his now seared brow bedewed with the waters of holy baptism. In early childhood, a fair-haired woman had led him, at the sound of Sabbath bell, to worship and to pray. Far in New England that mother had trained her only son, with long, unwearied love, and patient prayers. Born of a hard-tempered sire, on whom that gentle woman had wasted a world of unvalued love, Legree had followed in the steps of his father. Boisterous, unruly, and tyrannical, he despised all her counsel, and would none of her reproof; and, at an early age, broke from her, to seek his fortunes at sea. He never came home but once, after; and then, his mother, with the yearning of a heart that must love something, and has nothing else to love, clung to him, and sought, with passionate prayers and entreaties, to win him from a life of sin, to his soul's eternal good.</p>
	<p>That was Legree's day of grace; then good angels called him; then he was almost persuaded, and mercy held him by the hand. His heart inly relented,—there was a conflict,—but sin got the victory, and he set all the force of his rough nature against the conviction of his conscience. He drank and swore,—was wilder and more brutal than ever. And, one night, when his mother, in the last agony of her despair, knelt at his feet, he spurned her from him,—threw her senseless on the floor, and, with brutal curses, fled to his ship. The next Legree heard of his mother was, when, one night, as he was carousing among drunken companions, a letter was put into his hand. He opened it, and a lock of long, curling hair fell from it, and twined about his fingers. The letter told him his mother was dead, and that, dying, she blest and forgave him.</p>
	<p>There is a dread, unhallowed necromancy of evil, that turns things sweetest and holiest to phantoms of horror and affright. That pale, loving mother,—her dying prayers, her forgiving love,—wrought in that demoniac heart of sin only as a damning sentence, bringing with it a fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation. Legree burned the hair, and burned the letter; and when he saw them hissing and crackling in the flame, inly shuddered as he thought of everlasting fires. He tried to drink, and revel, and swear away the memory; but often, in the deep night, whose solemn stillness arraigns the bad soul in forced communion with herself, he had seen that pale mother rising by his bedside, and felt the soft twining of that hair around his fingers, till the cold sweat would roll down his face, and he would spring from his bed in horror. Ye who have wondered to hear, in the same evangel, that God is love, and that God is a consuming fire, see ye not how, to the soul resolved in evil, perfect love is the most fearful torture, the seal and sentence of the direst despair?</p>
	<p>“Blast it!” said Legree to himself, as he sipped his liquor; “where did he get that? If it didn't look just like—whoo! I thought I'd forgot that. Curse me, if I think there's any such thing as forgetting anything, any how,—hang it! I'm lonesome! I mean to call Em. She hates me—the monkey! I don't care,—I'll <span class="hi">make</span> her come!”</p>
	<p>Legree stepped out into a large entry, which went up stairs, by what had formerly been a superb winding staircase; but the passage-way was dirty and dreary, encumbered with boxes and unsightly litter. The stairs, uncarpeted, seemed winding up, in the gloom, to nobody knew where! The pale moonlight streamed through a shattered fanlight over the door; the air was unwholesome and chilly, like that of a vault.</p>
	<p>Legree stopped at the foot of the stairs, and heard a voice singing. It seemed strange and ghostlike in that dreary old house, perhaps because of the already tremulous state of his nerves. Hark! what is it?</p>
	<p>A wild, pathetic voice, chants a hymn common among the slaves:</p>
	<div class="quote">
		<div class="stanza">
			<p> “O there'll be mourning, mourning, mourning, </p>
			<p>O there'll be mourning, at the judgment-seat of Christ!”</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<p>“Blast the girl!” said Legree. “I'll choke her.—Em! Em!” he called, harshly; but only a mocking echo from the walls answered him. The sweet voice still sung on:</p>
	<div class="quote">
		<div class="stanza">
			<p> “Parents and children there shall part!</p>
			<p>Parents and children there shall part!</p>
			<p>Shall part to meet no more!”</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<p>And clear and loud swelled through the empty halls the refrain,</p>

	<div class="quote">
		<div class="stanza">
			<p> “O there'll be mourning, mourning, mourning,</p>
			<p>O there'll be mourning, at the judgment-seat of Christ!”</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<p>Legree stopped. He would have been ashamed to tell of it, but large drops of sweat stood on his forehead, his heart beat heavy and thick with fear; he even thought he saw something white rising and glimmering in the gloom before him, and shuddered to think what if the form of his dead mother should suddenly appear to him.</p>
	<p>“I know one thing,” he said to himself, as he stumbled back in the sitting-room, and sat down; “I'll let that fellow alone, after this! What did I want of his cussed paper? I b'lieve I am bewitched, sure enough! I've been shivering and sweating, ever since! Where did he get that hair? It couldn't have been <span class="hi">that!</span> I burnt <span class="hi">that</span> up, I know I did! It would be a joke, if hair could rise from the dead!”</p>
	<p>Ah, Legree! that golden tress <span class="hi">was</span> charmed; each hair had in it a spell of terror and remorse for thee, and was used by a mightier power to bind thy cruel hands from inflicting uttermost evil on the helpless!</p>
	<p>“I say,” said Legree, stamping and whistling to the dogs, “wake up, some of you, and keep me company!” but the dogs only opened one eye at him, sleepily, and closed it again.</p>
	<p>“I'll have Sambo and Quimbo up here, to sing and dance one of their hell dances, and keep off these horrid notions,” said Legree; and, putting on his hat, he went on to the verandah, and blew a horn, with which he commonly summoned his two sable drivers.</p>
	<p>Legree was often wont, when in a gracious humor, to get these two worthies into his sitting-room, and, after warming them up with whiskey, amuse himself by setting them to singing, dancing or fighting, as the humor took him.</p>
	<p>It was between one and two o'clock at night, as Cassy was returning from her ministrations to poor Tom, that she heard the sound of wild shrieking, whooping, halloing, and singing, from the sitting-room, mingled with the barking of dogs, and other symptoms of general uproar.</p>
	<p>She came up on the verandah steps, and looked in. Legree and both the drivers, in a state of furious intoxication, were singing, whooping, upsetting chairs, and making all manner of ludicrous and horrid grimaces at each other.</p>
	<p>She rested her small, slender hand on the window-blind, and looked fixedly at them;—there was a world of anguish, scorn, and fierce bitterness, in her black eyes, as she did so. “Would it be a sin to rid the world of such a wretch?” she said to herself.</p>
	<p>She turned hurriedly away, and, passing round to a back door, glided up stairs, and tapped at Emmeline's door.</p>

					<p>Emmeline and Cassy</p>
				</div>
			
	<p class="dropcap"> Cassy entered the room, and found Emmeline sitting, pale with fear, in the furthest corner of it. As she came in, the girl started up nervously; but, on seeing who it was, rushed forward, and catching her arm, said, “O Cassy, is it you? I'm so glad you've come! I was afraid it was—. O, you don't know what a horrid noise there has been, down stairs, all this evening!”</p>
	<p>“I ought to know,” said Cassy, dryly. “I've heard it often enough.”</p>
	<p>“O Cassy! do tell me,—couldn't we get away from this place? I don't care where,—into the swamp among the snakes,—anywhere! <span class="hi">Couldn't</span> we get <span class="hi">somewhere</span> away from here?”</p>
	<p>“Nowhere, but into our graves,” said Cassy.</p>
	<p>“Did you ever try?”</p>
	<p>“I've seen enough of trying and what comes of it,” said Cassy.</p>
	<p>“I'd be willing to live in the swamps, and gnaw the bark from trees. I an't afraid of snakes! I'd rather have one near me than him,” said Emmeline, eagerly.</p>
	<p>“There have been a good many here of your opinion,” said Cassy; “but you couldn't stay in the swamps,—you'd be tracked by the dogs, and brought back, and then—then—”</p>
	<p>“What would he do?” said the girl, looking, with breathless interest, into her face.</p>
	<p>“What <span class="hi">wouldn't</span> he do, you'd better ask,” said Cassy. “He's learned his trade well, among the pirates in the West Indies. You wouldn't sleep much, if I should tell you things I've seen,—things that he tells of, sometimes, for good jokes. I've heard screams here that I haven't been able to get out of my head for weeks and weeks. There's a place way out down by the quarters, where you can see a black, blasted tree, and the ground all covered with black ashes. Ask anyone what was done there, and see if they will dare to tell you.”</p>
	<p>“O! what do you mean?”</p>
	<p>“I won't tell you. I hate to think of it. And I tell you, the Lord only knows what we may see tomorrow, if that poor fellow holds out as he's begun.”</p>
	<p>“Horrid!” said Emmeline, every drop of blood receding from her cheeks. “O, Cassy, do tell me what I shall do!”</p>
	<p>“What I've done. Do the best you can,—do what you must,—and make it up in hating and cursing.”</p>
	<p>“He wanted to make me drink some of his hateful brandy,” said Emmeline; “and I hate it so—”</p>
	<p>“You'd better drink,” said Cassy. “I hated it, too; and now I can't live without it. One must have something;—things don't look so dreadful, when you take that.”</p>
	<p>“Mother used to tell me never to touch any such thing,” said Emmeline.</p>
	<p>“Mother told you!” said Cassy, with a thrilling and bitter emphasis on the word mother. “What use is it for mothers to say anything? You are all to be bought and paid for, and your souls belong to whoever gets you. That's the way it goes. I say, <span class="hi">drink</span> brandy; drink all you can, and it'll make things come easier.”</p>
	<p>“O, Cassy! do pity me!”</p>
	<p>“Pity you!—don't I? Haven't I a daughter,—Lord knows where she is, and whose she is, now,—going the way her mother went, before her, I suppose, and that her children must go, after her! There's no end to the curse—forever!”</p>
	<p>“I wish I'd never been born!” said Emmeline, wringing her hands.</p>
	<p>“That's an old wish with me,” said Cassy. “I've got used to wishing that. I'd die, if I dared to,” she said, looking out into the darkness, with that still, fixed despair which was the habitual expression of her face when at rest.</p>
	<p>“It would be wicked to kill one's self,” said Emmeline.</p>
	<p>“I don't know why,—no wickeder than things we live and do, day after day. But the sisters told me things, when I was in the convent, that make me afraid to die. If it would only be the end of us, why, then—”</p>
	<p>Emmeline turned away, and hid her face in her hands.</p>
	<p>While this conversation was passing in the chamber, Legree, overcome with his carouse, had sunk to sleep in the room below. Legree was not an habitual drunkard. His coarse, strong nature craved, and could endure, a continual stimulation, that would have utterly wrecked and crazed a finer one. But a deep, underlying spirit of cautiousness prevented his often yielding to appetite in such measure as to lose control of himself.</p>
	<p>This night, however, in his feverish efforts to banish from his mind those fearful elements of woe and remorse which woke within him, he had indulged more than common; so that, when he had discharged his sable attendants, he fell heavily on a settle in the room, and was sound asleep.</p>
	<p>O! how dares the bad soul to enter the shadowy world of sleep?—that land whose dim outlines lie so fearfully near to the mystic scene of retribution! Legree dreamed. In his heavy and feverish sleep, a veiled form stood beside him, and laid a cold, soft hand upon him. He thought he knew who it was; and shuddered, with creeping horror, though the face was veiled. Then he thought he felt <span class="hi">that hair</span> twining round his fingers; and then, that it slid smoothly round his neck, and tightened and tightened, and he could not draw his breath; and then he thought voices <span class="hi">whispered</span> to him,—whispers that chilled him with horror. Then it seemed to him he was on the edge of a frightful abyss, holding on and struggling in mortal fear, while dark hands stretched up, and were pulling him over; and Cassy came behind him laughing, and pushed him. And then rose up that solemn veiled figure, and drew aside the veil. It was his mother; and she turned away from him, and he fell down, down, down, amid a confused noise of shrieks, and groans, and shouts of demon laughter,—and Legree awoke.</p>
	<p>Calmly the rosy hue of dawn was stealing into the room. The morning star stood, with its solemn, holy eye of light, looking down on the man of sin, from out the brightening sky. O, with what freshness, what solemnity and beauty, is each new day born; as if to say to insensate man, “Behold! thou hast one more chance! <span class="hi">Strive</span> for immortal glory!”  There is no speech nor language where this voice is not heard; but the bold, bad man heard it not. He woke with an oath and a curse. What to him was the gold and purple, the daily miracle of morning! What to him the sanctity of the star which the Son of God has hallowed as his own emblem? Brute-like, he saw without perceiving; and, stumbling forward, poured out a tumbler of brandy, and drank half of it.</p>
	<p>“I've had a h—l of a night!” he said to Cassy, who just then entered from an opposite door.</p>
	<p>“You'll get plenty of the same sort, by and by,” said she, dryly.</p>
	<p>“What do you mean, you minx?”</p>
	<p>“You'll find out, one of these days,” returned Cassy, in the same tone. “Now Simon, I've one piece of advice to give you.”</p>
	<p>“The devil, you have!”</p>
	<p>“My advice is,” said Cassy, steadily, as she began adjusting some things about the room, “that you let Tom alone.”</p>
	<p>“What business is 't of yours?”</p>
	<p>“What? To be sure, I don't know what it should be. If you want to pay twelve hundred for a fellow, and use him right up in the press of the season, just to serve your own spite, it's no business of mine, I've done what I could for him.”</p>
	<p>“You have? What business have you meddling in my matters?”</p>
	<p>“None, to be sure. I've saved you some thousands of dollars, at different times, by taking care of your hands,—that's all the thanks I get. If your crop comes shorter into market than any of theirs, you won't lose your bet, I suppose? Tompkins won't lord it over you, I suppose,—and you'll pay down your money like a lady, won't you? I think I see you doing it!”</p>
	<p>Legree, like many other planters, had but one form of ambition,—to have in the heaviest crop of the season,—and he had several bets on this very present season pending in the next town. Cassy, therefore, with woman's tact, touched the only string that could be made to vibrate.</p>
	<p>“Well, I'll let him off at what he's got,” said Legree; “but he shall beg my pardon, and promise better fashions.”</p>
	<p>“That he won't do,” said Cassy.</p>
	<p>“Won't,—eh?”</p>
	<p>“No, he won't,” said Cassy.</p>
	<p>“I'd like to know <span class="hi">why</span>, Mistress,” said Legree, in the extreme of scorn.</p>
	<p>“Because he's done right, and he knows it, and won't say he's done wrong.”</p>
	<p>“Who a cuss cares what he knows? The nigger shall say what I please, or—”</p>
	<p>“Or, you'll lose your bet on the cotton crop, by keeping him out of the field, just at this very press.”</p>
	<p>“But he <span class="hi">will</span> give up,—course, he will; don't I know what niggers is? He'll beg like a dog, this morning.”</p>
	<p>“He won't, Simon; you don't know this kind. You may kill him by inches,—you won't get the first word of confession out of him.”</p>
	<p>“We'll see,—where is he?” said Legree, going out.</p>
	<p>“In the waste-room of the gin-house,” said Cassy.</p>
	<p>Legree, though he talked so stoutly to Cassy, still sallied forth from the house with a degree of misgiving which was not common with him. His dreams of the past night, mingled with Cassy's prudential suggestions, considerably affected his mind. He resolved that nobody should be witness of his encounter with Tom; and determined, if he could not subdue him by bullying, to defer his vengeance, to be wreaked in a more convenient season.</p>
	<p>The solemn light of dawn—the angelic glory of the morning-star—had looked in through the rude window of the shed where Tom was lying; and, as if descending on that star-beam, came the solemn words, “I am the root and offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.” The mysterious warnings and intimations of Cassy, so far from discouraging his soul, in the end had roused it as with a heavenly call. He did not know but that the day of his death was dawning in the sky; and his heart throbbed with solemn throes of joy and desire, as he thought that the wondrous <span class="hi">all</span>, of which he had often pondered,—the great white throne, with its ever radiant rainbow; the white-robed multitude, with voices as many waters; the crowns, the palms, the harps,—might all break upon his vision before that sun should set again. And, therefore, without shuddering or trembling, he heard the voice of his persecutor, as he drew near.</p>
	<p>“Well, my boy,” said Legree, with a contemptuous kick, “how do you find yourself? Didn't I tell yer I could larn yer a thing or two? How do yer like it—eh? How did yer whaling agree with yer, Tom? An't quite so crank as ye was last night. Ye couldn't treat a poor sinner, now, to a bit of sermon, could ye,—eh?”</p>
	<p>Tom answered nothing.</p>
	<p>“Get up, you beast!” said Legree, kicking him again.</p>
	<p>This was a difficult matter for one so bruised and faint; and, as Tom made efforts to do so, Legree laughed brutally.</p>
	<p>“What makes ye so spry, this morning, Tom? Cotched cold, may be, last night.”</p>
	<p>Tom by this time had gained his feet, and was confronting his master with a steady, unmoved front.</p>
	<p>“The devil, you can!” said Legree, looking him over. “I believe you haven't got enough yet. Now, Tom, get right down on yer knees and beg my pardon, for yer shines last night.”</p>
	<p>Tom did not move.</p>
	<p>“Down, you dog!” said Legree, striking him with his riding-whip.</p>
	<p>“Mas'r Legree,” said Tom, “I can't do it. I did only what I thought was right. I shall do just so again, if ever the time comes. I never will do a cruel thing, come what may.”</p>
	<p>“Yes, but ye don't know what may come, Master Tom. Ye think what you've got is something. I tell you 'tan't anything,—nothing 't all. How would ye like to be tied to a tree, and have a slow fire lit up around ye;—wouldn't that be pleasant,—eh, Tom?”</p>
	<p>“Mas'r,” said Tom, “I know ye can do dreadful things; but,”—he stretched himself upward and clasped his hands,—“but, after ye've killed the body, there an't no more ye can do. And O, there's all ETERNITY to come, after that!”</p>
	<p>ETERNITY,—the word thrilled through the black man's soul with light and power, as he spoke; it thrilled through the sinner's soul, too, like the bite of a scorpion. Legree gnashed on him with his teeth, but rage kept him silent; and Tom, like a man disenthralled, spoke, in a clear and cheerful voice,</p>
	<p>“Mas'r Legree, as ye bought me, I'll be a true and faithful servant to ye. I'll give ye all the work of my hands, all my time, all my strength; but my soul I won't give up to mortal man. I will hold on to the Lord, and put his commands before all,—die or live; you may be sure on 't. Mas'r Legree, I ain't a grain afeard to die. I'd as soon die as not. Ye may whip me, starve me, burn me,—it'll only send me sooner where I want to go.”</p>
	<p>“I'll make ye give out, though, 'fore I've done!” said Legree, in a rage.</p>
	<p>“I shall have <span class="hi">help</span>,” said Tom; “you'll never do it.”</p>
	<p>“Who the devil's going to help you?” said Legree, scornfully.</p>
	<p>“The Lord Almighty,” said Tom.</p>
	<p>“D—n you!” said Legree, as with one blow of his fist he felled Tom to the earth.</p>
	<p>A cold soft hand fell on Legree's at this moment. He turned,—it was Cassy's; but the cold soft touch recalled his dream of the night before, and, flashing through the chambers of his brain, came all the fearful images of the night-watches, with a portion of the horror that accompanied them.</p>
	<p>“Will you be a fool?” said Cassy, in French. “Let him go! Let me alone to get him fit to be in the field again. Isn't it just as I told you?”</p>
	<p>They say the alligator, the rhinoceros, though enclosed in bullet-proof mail, have each a spot where they are vulnerable; and fierce, reckless, unbelieving reprobates, have commonly this point in superstitious dread.</p>
	<p>Legree turned away, determined to let the point go for the time.</p>
	<p>“Well, have it your own way,” he said, doggedly, to Cassy.</p>
	<p>“Hark, ye!” he said to Tom; “I won't deal with ye now, because the business is pressing, and I want all my hands; but I <span class="hi">never</span> forget. I'll score it against ye, and sometime I'll have my pay out o' yer old black hide,—mind ye!”</p>
	<p>Legree turned, and went out.</p>
	<p>“There you go,” said Cassy, looking darkly after him; “your reckoning's to come, yet!—My poor fellow, how are you?”</p>
	<p>“The Lord God hath sent his angel, and shut the lion's mouth, for this time,” said Tom.</p>
	<p>“For this time, to be sure,” said Cassy; “but now you've got his ill will upon you, to follow you day in, day out, hanging like a dog on your throat,—sucking your blood, bleeding away your life, drop by drop. I know the man.”</p>

		<p> “No matter with what solemnities he may have been devoted upon the altar of slavery, the moment he touches the sacred soil of Britain, the altar and the God sink together in the dust, and he stands redeemed, regenerated, and disenthralled, by the irresistible genius of universal emancipation.”</p>

	<p class="dropcap">A while we must leave Tom in the hands of his persecutors, while we turn to pursue the fortunes of George and his wife, whom we left in friendly hands, in a farmhouse on the road-side.</p>
	<p>Tom Loker we left groaning and touzling in a most immaculately clean Quaker bed, under the motherly supervision of Aunt Dorcas, who found him to the full as tractable a patient as a sick bison.</p>
	<p>Imagine a tall, dignified, spiritual woman, whose clear muslin cap shades waves of silvery hair, parted on a broad, clear forehead, which overarches thoughtful gray eyes. A snowy handkerchief of lisse crape is folded neatly across her bosom; her glossy brown silk dress rustles peacefully, as she glides up and down the chamber.</p>
	<p>“The devil!” says Tom Loker, giving a great throw to the bedclothes.</p>
	<p>“I must request thee, Thomas, not to use such language,” says Aunt Dorcas, as she quietly rearranged the bed.</p>
	<p>“Well, I won't, granny, if I can help it,” says Tom; “but it is enough to make a fellow swear,—so cursedly hot!”</p>
	<p>Dorcas removed a comforter from the bed, straightened the clothes again, and tucked them in till Tom looked something like a chrysalis; remarking, as she did so,</p>
	<p>“I wish, friend, thee would leave off cursing and swearing, and think upon thy ways.”</p>
	<p>“What the devil,” said Tom, “should I think of <span class="hi">them</span> for? Last thing ever <span class="hi">I</span> want to think of—hang it all!” And Tom flounced over, untucking and disarranging everything, in a manner frightful to behold.</p>
	<p>“That fellow and gal are here, I s'pose,” said he, sullenly, after a pause.</p>
	<p>“They are so,” said Dorcas.</p>
	<p>“They'd better be off up to the lake,” said Tom; “the quicker the better.”</p>
	<p>“Probably they will do so,” said Aunt Dorcas, knitting peacefully.</p>
	<p>“And hark ye,” said Tom; “we've got correspondents in Sandusky, that watch the boats for us. I don't care if I tell, now. I hope they <span class="hi">will</span> get away, just to spite Marks,—the cursed puppy!—d—n him!”</p>
	<p>“Thomas!” said Dorcas.</p>
	<p>“I tell you, granny, if you bottle a fellow up too tight, I shall split,” said Tom. “But about the gal,—tell 'em to dress her up some way, so's to alter her. Her description's out in Sandusky.”</p>
	<p>“We will attend to that matter,” said Dorcas, with characteristic composure.</p>
	<p>As we at this place take leave of Tom Loker, we may as well say, that, having lain three weeks at the Quaker dwelling, sick with a rheumatic fever, which set in, in company with his other afflictions, Tom arose from his bed a somewhat sadder and wiser man; and, in place of slave-catching, betook himself to life in one of the new settlements, where his talents developed themselves more happily in trapping bears, wolves, and other inhabitants of the forest, in which he made himself quite a name in the land. Tom always spoke reverently of the Quakers. “Nice people,” he would say; “wanted to convert me, but couldn't come it, exactly. But, tell ye what, stranger, they do fix up a sick fellow first rate,—no mistake. Make jist the tallest kind o' broth and knicknacks.”</p>
	<p>As Tom had informed them that their party would be looked for in Sandusky, it was thought prudent to divide them. Jim, with his old mother, was forwarded separately; and a night or two after, George and Eliza, with their child, were driven privately into Sandusky, and lodged beneath a hospital roof, preparatory to taking their last passage on the lake.</p>
	<p>Their night was now far spent, and the morning star of liberty rose fair before them!—electric word! What is it? Is there anything more in it than a name—a rhetorical flourish? Why, men and women of America, does your heart's blood thrill at that word, for which your fathers bled, and your braver mothers were willing that their noblest and best should die?</p>
	<p>Is there anything in it glorious and dear for a nation, that is not also glorious and dear for a man? What is freedom to a nation, but freedom to the individuals in it? What is freedom to that young man, who sits there, with his arms folded over his broad chest, the tint of African blood in his cheek, its dark fires in his eyes,—what is freedom to George Harris? To your fathers, freedom was the right of a nation to be a nation. To him, it is the right of a man to be a man, and not a brute; the right to call the wife of his bosom his wife, and to protect her from lawless violence; the right to protect and educate his child; the right to have a home of his own, a religion of his own, a character of his own, unsubject to the will of another. All these thoughts were rolling and seething in George's breast, as he was pensively leaning his head on his hand, watching his wife, as she was adapting to her slender and pretty form the articles of man's attire, in which it was deemed safest she should make her escape.</p>
	<p>“Now for it,” said she, as she stood before the glass, and shook down her silky abundance of black curly hair. “I say, George, it's almost a pity, isn't it,” she said, as she held up some of it, playfully,—“pity it's all got to come off?”</p>
	<p>George smiled sadly, and made no answer.</p>
	<p>Eliza turned to the glass, and the scissors glittered as one long lock after another was detached from her head.</p>
	<p>“There, now, that'll do,” she said, taking up a hair-brush; “now for a few fancy touches.”</p>
	<p>“There, an't I a pretty young fellow?” she said, turning around to her husband, laughing and blushing at the same time.</p>
	<p>“You always will be pretty, do what you will,” said George.</p>
	<p>“What does make you so sober?” said Eliza, kneeling on one knee, and laying her hand on his. “We are only within twenty-four hours of Canada, they say. Only a day and a night on the lake, and then—oh, then!—”</p>
	<p>“O, Eliza!” said George, drawing her towards him; “that is it! Now my fate is all narrowing down to a point. To come so near, to be almost in sight, and then lose all. I should never live under it, Eliza.”</p>
	<p>“Don't fear,” said his wife, hopefully. “The good Lord would not have brought us so far, if he didn't mean to carry us through. I seem to feel him with us, George.”</p>
	<p>“You are a blessed woman, Eliza!” said George, clasping her with a convulsive grasp. “But,—oh, tell me! can this great mercy be for us? Will these years and years of misery come to an end?—shall we be free?</p>
	<p>“I am sure of it, George,” said Eliza, looking upward, while tears of hope and enthusiasm shone on her long, dark lashes. “I feel it in me, that God is going to bring us out of bondage, this very day.”</p>
	<p>“I will believe you, Eliza,” said George, rising suddenly up, “I will believe,—come let's be off. Well, indeed,” said he, holding her off at arm's length, and looking admiringly at her, “you <span class="hi">are</span> a pretty little fellow. That crop of little, short curls, is quite becoming. Put on your cap. So—a little to one side. I never saw you look quite so pretty. But, it's almost time for the carriage;—I wonder if Mrs. Smyth has got Harry rigged?”</p>
	<p>The door opened, and a respectable, middle-aged woman entered, leading little Harry, dressed in girl's clothes.</p>
	<p>“What a pretty girl he makes,” said Eliza, turning him round. “We call him Harriet, you see;—don't the name come nicely?”</p>
	<p>The child stood gravely regarding his mother in her new and strange attire, observing a profound silence, and occasionally drawing deep sighs, and peeping at her from under his dark curls.</p>
	<p>“Does Harry know mamma?” said Eliza, stretching her hands toward him.</p>
	<p>The child clung shyly to the woman.</p>
	<p>“Come Eliza, why do you try to coax him, when you know that he has got to be kept away from you?”</p>
	<p>“I know it's foolish,” said Eliza; “yet, I can't bear to have him turn away from me. But come,—where's my cloak? Here,—how is it men put on cloaks, George?”</p>
	<p>“You must wear it so,” said her husband, throwing it over his shoulders.</p>
	<p>“So, then,” said Eliza, imitating the motion,—“and I must stamp, and take long steps, and try to look saucy.”</p>
	<p>“Don't exert yourself,” said George. “There is, now and then, a modest young man; and I think it would be easier for you to act that character.”</p>
	<p>“And these gloves! mercy upon us!” said Eliza; “why, my hands are lost in them.”</p>
	<p>“I advise you to keep them on pretty strictly,” said George. “Your slender paw might bring us all out. Now, Mrs. Smyth, you are to go under our charge, and be our aunty,—you mind.”</p>
	<p>“I've heard,” said Mrs. Smyth, “that there have been men down, warning all the packet captains against a man and woman, with a little boy.”</p>
	<p>“They have!” said George. “Well, if we see any such people, we can tell them.”</p>
	<p>A hack now drove to the door, and the friendly family who had received the fugitives crowded around them with farewell greetings.</p>
	<p>The disguises the party had assumed were in accordance with the hints of Tom Loker. Mrs. Smyth, a respectable woman from the settlement in Canada, whither they were fleeing, being fortunately about crossing the lake to return thither, had consented to appear as the aunt of little Harry; and, in order to attach him to her, he had been allowed to remain, the two last days, under her sole charge; and an extra amount of petting, jointed to an indefinite amount of seed-cakes and candy, had cemented a very close attachment on the part of the young gentleman.</p>
	<p>The hack drove to the wharf. The two young men, as they appeared, walked up the plank into the boat, Eliza gallantly giving her arm to Mrs. Smyth, and George attending to their baggage.</p>
	<p>George was standing at the captain's office, settling for his party, when he overheard two men talking by his side.</p>
	<p>“I've watched every one that came on board,” said one, “and I know they're not on this boat.”</p>
	<p>The voice was that of the clerk of the boat. The speaker whom he addressed was our sometime friend Marks, who, with that valuable perseverance which characterized him, had come on to Sandusky, seeking whom he might devour.</p>
	<p>“You would scarcely know the woman from a white one,” said Marks. “The man is a very light mulatto; he has a brand in one of his hands.”</p>
	<p>The hand with which George was taking the tickets and change trembled a little; but he turned coolly around, fixed an unconcerned glance on the face of the speaker, and walked leisurely toward another part of the boat, where Eliza stood waiting for him.</p>
	<p>Mrs. Smyth, with little Harry, sought the seclusion of the ladies' cabin, where the dark beauty of the supposed little girl drew many flattering comments from the passengers.</p>
	<p>George had the satisfaction, as the bell rang out its farewell peal, to see Marks walk down the plank to the shore; and drew a long sigh of relief, when the boat had put a returnless distance between them.</p>
	<p>It was a superb day. The blue waves of Lake Erie danced, rippling and sparkling, in the sun-light. A fresh breeze blew from the shore, and the lordly boat ploughed her way right gallantly onward.</p>
	<p>O, what an untold world there is in one human heart! Who thought, as George walked calmly up and down the deck of the steamer, with his shy companion at his side, of all that was burning in his bosom? The mighty good that seemed approaching seemed too good, too fair, even to be a reality; and he felt a jealous dread, every moment of the day, that something would rise to snatch it from him.</p>
	<p>But the boat swept on. Hours fleeted, and, at last, clear and full rose the blessed English shores; shores charmed by a mighty spell,—with one touch to dissolve every incantation of slavery, no matter in what language pronounced, or by what national power confirmed.</p>
	<p>George and his wife stood arm in arm, as the boat neared the small town of Amherstberg, in Canada. His breath grew thick and short; a mist gathered before his eyes; he silently pressed the little hand that lay trembling on his arm. The bell rang; the boat stopped. Scarcely seeing what he did, he looked out his baggage, and gathered his little party. The little company were landed on the shore. They stood still till the boat had cleared; and then, with tears and embracings, the husband and wife, with their wondering child in their arms, knelt down and lifted up their hearts to God!</p>

	</div>
	<p>The little party were soon guided, by Mrs. Smyth, to the hospitable abode of a good missionary, whom Christian charity has placed here as a shepherd to the outcast and wandering, who are constantly finding an asylum on this shore.</p>
	<p>Who can speak the blessedness of that first day of freedom? Is not the <span class="hi">sense</span> of liberty a higher and a finer one than any of the five? To move, speak and breathe,—go out and come in unwatched, and free from danger! Who can speak the blessings of that rest which comes down on the free man's pillow, under laws which insure to him the rights that God has given to man? How fair and precious to that mother was that sleeping child's face, endeared by the memory of a thousand dangers! How impossible was it to sleep, in the exuberant possession of such blessedness! And yet, these two had not one acre of ground,—not a roof that they could call their own,—they had spent their all, to the last dollar. They had nothing more than the birds of the air, or the flowers of the field,—yet they could not sleep for joy. “O, ye who take freedom from man, with what words shall ye answer it to God?”</p>

<h3 class="ct">Note on the Text</h3>

<p class="pf"><span class="it">Uncle Tom's Cabin; Or Life Among the Lonely</span> was first published serially in the abolitionist weekly <span class="it"> The National Era</span>, from 1851-52. The story proved to be instantly popular and Boston publisher John P. Jewett & Co. contacted Stowe to turn the work into a book. Confident the book would be a success, Jewett made the unusual decision to have six full-page illustrations engraved for the first edition. The text of this ebook edition is based on Project Gutenberg files and scans of the first edition available on Archive.Org. Sources for documents in "Background and Context" are individually listed there. </p>
<p>This edition <span class="it">Uncle Tom's Cabin</span> was prepared for students at the City University of New York. It is offered under a Creative Commons license under which the edition may freely read, shared, and edited.
